## Viewing temple schedule output
Temple schedules can be output as either an HTML file or an Excel file. For the HTML format, I've found it's easiest to open this in Chrome, then convert it to PDF using the [GoFullPage - Full Page Screen Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en)
extension. Then it can be converted to other formats from there. Here are some sample temple schedules generated by this tool.
